# Overview

This repository focuses on using SHAP and LIME to interpret models trained on the breast cancer dataset. I experiment with various ML models, including
Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernels, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to understand their decision-making processes.

The last section is dedicated to the design and implementation of user studies to evaluate how ML model explanations affect the decision-making process
of practitioners. I aim to gather feedback on how well users understand the model predictions with the help of LIME.

These experiments are the foundation for my paper **Between Safety and Performance: Identifying and Measuring the Trade-Off between Interpretability and Predictive Performance**.
